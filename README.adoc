# catlol: like lolcat but written in C

https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat[lolcat] is a nice script for colorizing terminal output.
This is a simplified rewrite in C that performs a little better on some of my more minimalist computers.
It does not currently implement all the functionality of the original lolcat.
